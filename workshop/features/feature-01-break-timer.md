# Feature 01: Break Timer

## Description

The `break_minutes` setting is already stored in the database and editable via the Settings
modal, but nothing in the app currently uses it. This feature implements the break countdown:
when a focus session completes, the UI automatically transitions to a **Break** state and
counts down from `break_minutes` so the user knows when their break is over.

## Current Behaviour

After a session completes the UI shows `IDLE` and the `break_minutes` value sits unused.

## Target Behaviour

1. A focus session completes (countdown reaches 0:00).
2. The UI immediately transitions to a **Break** state.
3. A countdown timer runs from `break_minutes` down to `0:00`, labelled "BREAK".
4. When the break countdown reaches 0 the UI returns to **IDLE** and a subtle notification
   is shown ("Break over — ready when you are").
5. The user can click **Skip Break** at any time to return to IDLE early.

## Spec Reference

- **FR-020 (post-MVP)**: Break tracking — after a completed focus session, display a
  countdown for the configured break duration.
- **Settings**: `break_minutes` stored in `settings` table; readable via `GET /settings`.
- The spec explicitly marks this as the first post-MVP feature to implement.

## Files to Change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `frontend/src/hooks/useTimerService.ts` | Add `break` state; start break countdown after session completes |
| `frontend/src/components/TimerDisplay.tsx` | Render "BREAK" label and `data-status="break"` |
| `frontend/src/components/Controls.tsx` | Render **Skip Break** button during break state |
| `frontend/src/index.css` | Add colour token + styles for break state (e.g. `--teal`) |

No backend changes are needed — `break_minutes` is already persisted and returned by
`GET /settings`.

## Workshop Exercise

Work through the steps below in order. This is a **new feature** rather than a bug fix, so
the workflow starts with `/speckit.specify` to draft the user story, then uses
`/speckit.tasks` to plan the work before any code is written.

Speckit will automatically create the branch `workshop/feature-01-break-timer` and
save spec artifacts to `specs/feature-01-break-timer/` when you run the first command below.

---

### Step 1 — Write the user story (`/speckit.specify`)

Use `/speckit.specify` to encode the feature as a user story with testable acceptance criteria.

**Run this command:**
```
/speckit.specify
```

**Describe the feature:**
> "As a user, when my focus session completes I want the app to automatically start a
> break countdown using my configured break duration, so I know exactly how long to rest
> before the next session. I should be able to skip the break early if I want to start
> sooner."

**What to look for in the output:**
- A user story that references `break_minutes` from settings.
- At least two acceptance criteria:
  1. *"When a session completes, the timer transitions to BREAK state and counts down from
     `break_minutes`."*
  2. *"Clicking Skip Break returns the timer to IDLE before the countdown ends."*
- Save these criteria — you'll encode them as test assertions in Step 3.

---

### Step 2 — Generate implementation tasks (`/speckit.tasks`)

Use `/speckit.tasks` to break the feature into ordered, concrete implementation steps before
writing a line of code.

**Run this command:**
```
/speckit.tasks
```

**Describe the scope:**
> "Generate tasks for the break timer feature: (1) extend the `TimerStore` Zustand store
> with a `break` status and `breakRemainingSeconds` field, (2) after a completed countdown
> in `useTimerService`, start a break countdown from `settings.break_minutes`, (3) add a
> Skip Break button in `Controls.tsx` visible only during break state, (4) update
> `TimerDisplay` to show the BREAK label and `data-status='break'`, (5) add CSS for the
> break state, (6) write Vitest unit tests for each new behaviour."

**What to look for in the output:**
- A numbered task list you can work through sequentially.
- Each task should reference a specific file and function.

---

### Step 3 — Write failing tests

Before changing any implementation code, write tests for the two acceptance criteria:

```tsx
// frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useTimerService.test.ts

it('transitions to break state after session completes', async () => {
  // Mock GET /settings returning break_minutes: 5
  // Advance timer until remaining_seconds hits 0
  // Assert store status === 'break' and breakRemainingSeconds === 300
});

it('skip break returns to idle', async () => {
  // Put store in break state
  // Call store.skipBreak()
  // Assert store status === 'idle'
});
```

Run to confirm they **fail**:
```bash
cd frontend && npm test
```

---

### Step 4 — Implement the feature

Work through the tasks generated in Step 2, in order:

1. **Extend the store** — add `break` to the `TimerStatus` union type and add
   `breakRemainingSeconds: number` to the Zustand store slice.

2. **Start the break countdown** — in `useTimerService.ts`, when the focus countdown
   reaches 0, read `settings.break_minutes` and set `status = 'break'` with
   `breakRemainingSeconds = break_minutes * 60`.

3. **Tick the break countdown** — in the `useEffect` interval, if `status === 'break'`,
   decrement `breakRemainingSeconds` each second; when it reaches 0, set `status = 'idle'`.

4. **Add Skip Break** — expose a `skipBreak()` action in the store that sets
   `status = 'idle'`; wire it to a button in `Controls.tsx`.

5. **Update TimerDisplay** — pass `data-status="break"` and display `BREAK` label.

6. **Add CSS** — add a `--teal` token and colour the ring/label during break state:
   ```css
   [data-status='break'] .timer-countdown { color: var(--teal, #0d9488); }
   ```

---

### Step 5 — Verify

```bash
# All frontend tests must pass (including the two new ones)
cd frontend && npm test

# Type check & lint
npm run typecheck && npm run lint
```

All checks must be green before the exercise is complete.
